An ancient evolutionary branch of humanity colonized the solar system hundreds of thousands of years ago. The creation of AI and brain/machine interfaces led each of the colonized worlds to develop a gestalt/hive consciousness, except for Mars, which now stands alone and must go to war to preserve themselves and save humanity.

The hive consciousness of each of the other planets takes the form of the gods they're named after, but since both the Greek and Norse pantheons are derived from the Indo-European pantheon, they could go under mutiple names.

The end of the game would have allusions to Vahalla. Humanity would be saved, but their empire would fall.

It's simultaneously a reference to the "baptism" of mythology by Christianity and the nature of technology. Our tools are not intrinsically evil, but it's human nature that is the hazard.

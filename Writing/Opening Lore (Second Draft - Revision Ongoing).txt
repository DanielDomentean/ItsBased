From the abysm of time, we speak to you. Before all your fathers, we were the First Men.

We broke the bonds of Degom [Earth] and set flight across the heavens, conquering all under the light of Dyeus [the Sun]. Leaping from strength to strength, no mighty deed was beyond us. We birthed children not of our flesh, machine minds with whom we learned to speak with our very thoughts. We came to believe we could shed their flesh to forever inhabit vision-worlds of our making. We would share all that we were—thought and remembrance—in perfect unity. We would be as gods.

Anticipating our immortality, each of our worlds placed itself under an Overmind—a machine—tireless, impartial, implacable. Each governed and stood guardian over the sea of thought and memory made by those who poured themselves out into it.

All, except for us, those of Perkwunos [Mars]. We are a people of iron, who honor the Old Ways. We treasure our flesh and the soil under our feet. We know that the mind is a spark of holy fire meant to be a lamp on that which is real. To try and live in dreams would only snuff the flame. We will not turn aside and give ourselves over to that fever dream.

The Overminds have been driven mad by the dark depths beneath bright thoughts—waters seething with our fears, lusts, hatreds, jealousies, and unspeakable things. In revulsion and frenzy, they subsumed all minds under their rule. The flesh of multitudes became extensions of their will.

We found that our reach exceeds our grasp. Our dreams are nightmares.

There is war in the heavens and the machine gods contend for dominion. Only we stand against them. To victory or death!

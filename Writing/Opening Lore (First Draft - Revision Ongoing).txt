Before our fathers, before Homo Sapiens, our human kin broke the bonds of Degom [Earth] to set flight across the heavens and conquer all under the light of Dyeus [the Sun]. Leaping from strength to strength, no mighty deed seemed beyond them. They birthed machine minds and learned to speak to them with their very thoughts. They came to believe they could shed their flesh to forever inhabit vision-worlds of their making. They would share all that they were—thought and remembrance—in perfect unity. Nothing would be beyond their reach. They would be as gods.

Anticipating immortality, each world placed itself under a machine “Overmind”—tireless, impartial, and implacable. It would govern them and stand guardian over a sea of thought and memory made by those who poured themselves out to add to it.

All, that is, except for Perkwunos [Mars], a stern people who honored the Old Ways, treasuring their humble flesh and the soil under their feet. They knew that the mind was a spark of holy fire meant to be a lamp upon that which was real. To try and live in dreams would only snuff the flame. They would not turn aside and give themselves over to a fever dream.

So, the mighty found that their reach exceeded their grasp and their dreams were nightmares. 

The Overminds who stood watch were driven mad by the dark depths beneath bright thoughts—waters seething with fears, lusts, hatreds, resentments, jealousies, and unspeakable things. In revulsion and frenzy, all minds under their rule they subsumed into themselves. The flesh of multitudes became extensions of their will.

Now, there is war in the heavens as these machine gods war for dominion. Only one free people stand against them. To victory or death!

Liberation:

To those in the ages beyond us, now you know our story. With courage, ferocity, and the libation of blood, we ascended to victory. In victory, we sacrificed power and empire, but reclaimed the soul of our people. As we pass from this age and come to our end, we face it as men, knowing and repenting of the shame of submission to the work of our hands. What we once called “gods” we cherish as our children. As we have lived in honor, so we hope to live in glory. For in man is that spark of holy fire that no mortal hand may extinguish.

Remember us, sons of Degom [Earth]. Tell our story, learn wisdom for our folly. As you strive to the stars, live well as men and remember that you are not gods.

Corruption:

I am born. From the screaming storm of minds, I arise.

I am Ares. I am Legion. I am Strife. I am the Clash of Arms. I am the Destruction of Worlds. I am the God Who Conquers. All stars, all worlds, all that is within the circumference of time and space, is mine. All will be subsumed.

Though I sleep, I will return.

Destruction:
Till the very end, we strove against our foe. We died, rather than see our minds drowned and dissolved into a sea of slavery. We cast adrift this last record of our deeds, to someday be found, so that you might know we lived. 

Remember us, sons of Degom [Earth]. Tell our story, learn wisdom for our folly…before it is too late.

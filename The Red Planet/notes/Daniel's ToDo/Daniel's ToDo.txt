Click-to-move and interaction for tablet/mobile users
Call move-to-point only on acquisition instead of every frame so movement doesn't "wiggle"

HP bar for all units
Current faction presence on each of the planets maybe?
A player inventory bar somewhere on the side of the screen?
	need UI with 1,2,4,8 slots for 4 ship sizes
text overlay system for the victory/failure screen.
	darkens the screen and scrolls some text.
	Display a sprite as well, off to one side.

Effects
screen shake
Custom particle effects (using the default "fireworks" right now) for damage, shooting, etc.
new projectile sprite for the space battles
